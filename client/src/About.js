                Hi! Welcome to BeatCoder! BeatCoder is my final project at Flatiron coding bootcamp. 
                I started BeatCoder out of a desire to pursue something musical once again, and as a
                challenge to myself. So please, enjoy tapping out beats to your hearts content. To use BeatCoder,
                either click on the preexisting buttons, or use 0 - 9 on your keyboard. MP3 and WAV files 
                can also be uploaded to BeatCoder to use in your own sound packs.
